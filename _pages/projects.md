Rethinking the mini-map: A navigational aid to support spatial learning in urban game environments
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview
========

- Our study investigates the impact of game navigation aids on spatial knowledge development in virtual environments.

Objective
=========

- Examine the effectiveness of landmark-based verbal directions compared to traditional mini-maps.

Methodology
===========

- Conducted a randomized comparative study.
- Evaluated the influence of different navigation aids on spatial knowledge and navigational efficiency.

Key Findings
============

- Confirmed the superiority of verbal directions in enhancing spatial knowledge.
- Acknowledged mini-maps' better navigational efficiency.

Implications
============

- Suggested a shift towards designing navigation aids that balance navigational efficiency and spatial learning in virtual environments.

Future Directions
=================

- Further exploration to define ideal design parameters for optimizing navigation aids in gaming environments.
