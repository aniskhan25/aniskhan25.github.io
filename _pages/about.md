Hi, I am Daniel.  

I obtained a PhD in Atmospheric and Climate Science at [ETH Zurich](https://iac.ethz.ch/group/atmospheric-dynamics.html) in May 2019.   
The focus of my research was on atmospheric and climate dynamics, aimed at analysing physical processes governing the large-scale circulation and high-impact weather phenomena such as atmospheric blocking and windstorms.  
After I got my PhD, I worked for two years as a NatCat Risk Modeler for a Swiss insurance company.
Currently, I am a PostDoc at the Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Bern. Learn more about my project [here](https://www.geography.unibe.ch/about_us/staff/dr_steinfeld_daniel/index_eng.html).
