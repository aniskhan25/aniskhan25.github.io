Hi, it is nice to meet you :)

My name is Daniel Steinfeld and I started in April 2021 a PostDoc position at the Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Bern. My project focuses on present and future forest fires in Switzerland and is in collaboration with the Canton of Bern.  
A little bit about me: I did my Masters in Climate Sciences at the [University of Bern](https://www.oeschger.unibe.ch/studium/studienprogramme/index_ger.html) and my PhD in Atmospheric Dynamics at [ETH Zurich](https://iac.ethz.ch/group/atmospheric-dynamics.html). The focus of my research was on atmospheric and climate dynamics, aimed at analysing physical processes governing the large-scale circulation and high-impact weather phenomena such as atmospheric blocking and windstorms. Previously, I worked as a Natural Catastrophe Risk Modeler for a Swiss insurance company.
