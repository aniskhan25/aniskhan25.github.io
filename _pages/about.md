Hi, it's nice to meet you :)

My name is Anis Ur Rahman and I'm a PostDoc researcher at the Department of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Jyvaskyla. I'm working in close collaboration with high-performance computing experts at CSC (Finnish IT Center for Science) to develop pipelines for modelling and processing of massive biodiversity data with LUMI, Europe’s fastest petascale supercomputer. 

A little bit about me: I did my Masters in Informatics with specialization in Parallel and Distributed Systems at the [Universite Grenoble Alpes](https://mosig.imag.fr/) and my PhD in Computer Science at [Universite Grenoble Alpes](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/en). My doctoral dissertation explores computational modeling of visual attention, focusing on mechanisms involving various cues: static, dynamic, face, and color. Moreover, I evaluate eye movement predictions against eye-tracking data, study the impact of faces in videos, and propose real-time implementation using parallel architectures to enhance application quality and user experience.

Previously, I was as an Associate Professor at the Department of Computing, NUST-SEECS (Pakistan). In 2019, I worked at the Department of Information Systems (FSKTM University of Malaya) as a Research Fellow for one year. During the fellowship, I worked in engineering a comprehensive simulation framework to model and analyze large-scale smart farming ecosystems. Moreover, I explored strategies for optimizing sustainable resource utilization within fog federations for smart cities.
